## I made a Pathfinding visualizer app check it out https://rogermcgrath.github.io/pathfinding/
## This project's main goal is to put popular search algorithms in a visual mean to help them be more understandable. The algorithms being demonstrated are Dijkstra's, Breadth First search, Depth First search, A*, and Greedy Best First search.
